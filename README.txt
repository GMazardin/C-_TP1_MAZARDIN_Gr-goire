You'll find in it my 5 exercises, all done.

In order to access to them, you have to : 
	- Run the program
	- Input the number of the exercise 
	  you want to check
	- Add a few user inputs if needed for some
	  of the tasks asked. The code will 
	  always tell you when it needs them.

I hope you'll find what you are looking for in 
the source code, and enjoy !
